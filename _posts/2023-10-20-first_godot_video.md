Hi, everyone, hope you're all doing well.

I just want to make a quick announcement that this Sunday, October 22nd, we'll be putting out a Godot video tutorial covering some of the findings we've made during these first days of developing PARANOIA.

Moreover, instead of skimming through a lot of the content, as other tutorials do, I assume a lot of viewers are unexperienced, so I'll be explaining in a bit more detail _why_ I chose to apply certain code snippets instead of others.

In any case, I hope you'll drop by and give your input. I'll see you there :)
