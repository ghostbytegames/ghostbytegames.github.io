Some progress I wanted to show off today includes:

### Tank Controls (Completed!)

[Test\_paranoia1 (DEBUG) 2023-10-15 15-46-36.mp4](files\test_paranoia1-debug-2023-10-15-15-46-36.mp4)

Tank controls implemented properly! Now to implement fixed camera angles!

### Fixed and Follow Camera Angles (Completed!)

[Test\_paranoia1 (DEBUG) 2023-10-15 17-46-08.mp4](files\test_paranoia1-debug-2023-10-15-17-46-08.mp4)

[Test\_paranoia1 (DEBUG) 2023-10-15 22-17-54.mp4](files\test_paranoia1-debug-2023-10-15-22-17-54.mp4)

# Test 1 Completed!

Remarks to make:

- [ ] Refactor the character code to be cleaner (a lot of animation code is jumbled around and messy! not fun)   
- [ ] Need to implement a system for the character to have idle, walk and running animations depending on the weapon he's holding   
- [ ] Need to implement a system for the character to have idle, walk and running animations depending on his health   
- [ ] Need to link the character to whatever inventory system is implemented.

## Next, Inventory System!
