Some progress I wanted to show off today includes:

### Tank Controls (Completed!)

{% include video.html url="/assets/devlog3_1.mp4" %}

Tank controls implemented properly! Now to implement fixed camera angles!

### Fixed and Follow Camera Angles (Completed!)

{% include video.html url="/assets/devlog3_2.mp4" %}

{% include video.html url="/assets/devlog3_3.mp4" %}

# Test 1 Completed!

Remarks to make:

[] Refactor the character code to be cleaner (a lot of animation code is jumbled around and messy! not fun)
[] Need to implement a system for the character to have idle, walk and running animations depending on the weapon heâ€™s holding
[] Need to implement a system for the character to have idle, walk and running animations depending on his health
[] Need to link the character to whatever inventory system is implemented.

## Next, Inventory System!
