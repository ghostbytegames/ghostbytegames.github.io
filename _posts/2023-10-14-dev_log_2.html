Making a sample model for an M9 Beretta, which in my opinion, is the default option for a survival horror handgun. This will be also a good model to test! Some details are still necessary, but since this is a test model, it’s doable for now. <br />
Now, for some idle and walking animations! <br />

I also need made running animations and imported it to Godot, where I put them to the test. <br />
{% include video.html url="/assets/devlog2_3.mp4" %}  <br />
Set up viewport resolution. Matching PS1 res: 320x240. <br />

I think that’s enough work for today… tomorrow I’ll start working on the gun model again, and on how to implement an inventory system.</p>
