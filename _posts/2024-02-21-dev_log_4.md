I have decided that I'm going to make some pushbacks due to time constraints, motivation, mental health issues and overall stability.

The first big change is that the game will now be developed using RPG Maker MV. If it makes the game look icky, please note that we plan to port it back to 3D as planned in the future.

MV is more rudimentary, and 2D allows us some things that were more complicated in 3D.
